Control a remote R session from your local R session.  The packages uses [**pbdZMQ**](https://github.com/snoweye/pbdZMQ) to handle the communication and networking. The custom REPL is based off of [**pbdCS**](https://github.com/wrathematics/pbdCS).

Encryption is supported if the **sodium** package is installed.  Details below.



## Usage

For setting up a local server, you can do:

```r
remoter::server()
```

And connect to it via:

```r
remoter::client()
```

For more details, including working with remote machines, see the package vignette.



## Installation

You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.packages("remoter")
```

In order to be able to create and connect to secure servers, you should also install the **sodium** package.  You can install it manually with a call to `install.packages("sodium")` or by installing **remoter** via:

```r
install.packages("remoter", dependencies=TRUE)
```


#### Development Version

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

```r
### Pick your preference
devtools::install_github("RBigData/remoter")
ghit::install_github("RBigData/remoter")
remotes::install_github("RBigData/remoter")
```
