# Introduction

<img src="pics/remoter.png" style="width:250px" align="right">

The **remoter** package [[@remoter]] allows you to control a remote R session from a local one.  The local R session can be in a terminal, GUI, or IDE such as RStudio.  The remote R session should be run in the background as, well, a server.

The package uses **ZeroMQ** [[@zeromq]] by way of the R package **pbdZMQ** [[@Chen2015pbdZMQpackage]] to handle communication.  Our use of pbdZMQ is specialized to client/server communications, but the package is very general.  For more details about **pbdZMQ** see the **pbdZMQ** package vignette [[@Chen2015pbdZMQvignette]].

The work for remoter was born out of the **pbdCS** package [[@pbdCS]], which is part of the Programming with Big Data in R (pbdR) project [[@pbdR2012]]. pbdR is a series of R packages that enable the usage of the R language on large distributed machines, like clusters and supercomputers.  See [r-pbd.org/](http://r-pbd.org)) for details.



## Installation

You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.packages("remoter")
```

The development version is maintained on GitHub.  You can install this version using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("wrathematics/remoter")
```



# Clients and Servers:  Just the Basics

If you simply want to understand how **remoter** works, we do not need to involve remote computers right out the gate.  Instead, we will create a local server and connect to it from another local R session.

So the first thing to do is to start up 2 separate R sessions.  One will be the *server*, receiving commands, and the other will be the *client*, sending them.


## The Server

In the R process designated to be the server, we will use the `server()` command to, well, start the server.  Running this with no additional arguments will create a server.  Optionally, one can specify a password via the `password` argument.  Another useful feature is setting `showmsg=TRUE`, which will show in the server R process what messages are coming in.  For now, let's run it with `showmsg=TRUE`:

```r
remoter::server(showmsg=TRUE)
```

That's it!  That R session is now listening for commands.  We can shut the server down in a few ways.  Probably the best (particularly when dealing with remote machines) is from the client itself.  More on this later.  The other way is to kill the hosting R process.  Finally, you can terminate the server with `ctrl+c`, but the other methods are preferred.


## The Client

Once the server is set up, we can connect to it with the `client()` command.  Since we are connecting to a local server, the address we want to connect to is `"localhost"` (the default) or `"127.0.0.1"`.  We will have to make sure that the `port` argument matches the listening port of our server, or we'll never connect.  Finally, we can set the way the R prompt looks while the client is running by the `prompt` argument.  You can set it to whatever you like, but disambiguating between your regular, local R session and the **remoter** client is very useful.  Things can get confusing in a hurry if you aren't careful.

So to connect, in our R session designated to be the client (the only one left), we would enter:

```r
remoter::client()
```

And you should be good to go.  You can now enter R commands in the client and have them executed on the server.  The following section will go into more detail about specifics on using the client/server setup.






# Using remoter

Before proceeding, make sure you understand how to set up a client and a server.  See the previous section for details.


## Philosophy

By default, all code entered to the client is executed on the remote server.  There are several utility functions to help execute code on the local R session (see section below).  But you should assume that anything entered into the client session, *unless you explicitly specify to the contrary*, is executed only on the server.


## Utility Functions

There are a few utility functions available that have to do with handling execution of things locally or moving data between client and server.

By default, all commands entered inside of the client are executed on the server.  If you need to do some things in the local R session, you can kill the client and just reconnect when you're ready. Alternatively, you can use the `lsc()`, `rmc()`, and `evalc()` functions.  These are client versions of `ls()`, `rm()`, and `eval()`.  

For moving data between client and server, there are the `s2c()` and `c2s()` commands which transfer from server to client and from client to server, respectively.  These functions transfer data that resides in the memory of the client/server.  To transfer a file in chunks (without reading all of it into memory), see `?pbdZMQ::zmq.sendfile` or `?pbdZMQ::zmq.recvfile`.



## Shutting Things Down

To terminate the client, enter the command `exit()`.  By default, this will terminate the local client only, and leave the server running.  If you wish to also shut down the server with the client, you can run `exit(client.only=FALSE)`.  For hopefully obvious reasons, you can not terminate the server and leave the client running.

From the client side, running `exit()` will not shut down the interactive R session that was hosting the client.  You can also disconnect the client from the server without shutting down the server by killing the client R session or executing `Ctrl-c` in the client.







# Working with Remote Machines

Before we begin, a quick word about addresses and ports.  

An address should not include any protocols, like `tcp://` or `http://`.  The address should also not contain any ports (denoted by a `:`), as this value goes in a separate argument.

A port is a non-negative integer.  The minimum value for a valid port is 1024 (values 1-1023 are privileged), and the maximum value is 65535.  That said, you are strongly encouraged to use port values between 49152 and 65535. See `?pbdZMQ::random_port` for details.

Of course, all the usual issues apply.  The server should be able to accept communications on the desired port.  Opening ports is very standard stuff, but dependent on the system you are using, so consult relevant documentation if you aren't sure what to do.


## Creating a Remote Server

Before beginning, you need to spawn your server.  To do this, you can:

1. ssh to your remote (you only need to do this once!)
2. Start a **tmux** or **screen** session
3. Start R and run `remoter::server()` (see `?server` for additional options).  Or even better, run `Rscript -e remoter::server()` so the server dies if something goes wrong.
5. Detach your tmux/screen session and log out.

Alternatively, you can run the R session in the background by a fork via something like:

```r
Rscript -e "remoter::server()" &
```

Though I personally recommend using something like **tmux** or **screen** instead.


## Connecting to a Server

Connect as with a local server, but specifying the correct remote address:

```r
remoter::client("my.remote.address")
```

So for example, say you have set up a server (as described above) on EC2 with address `"ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com"`, listening on port `56789`. Then you would run:

```r
remoter::client("ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com", port=56789)
```

That's it.  Everything else should work just as when you were running the server locally.





# Problems, Bugs, and Other Maladies

The package should basically be useable, but there are some issues you might want to be aware of.

**Problem**: I lost my internet connection and the client is no longer sending messages.

**Solution**: Just `Ctrl+c` and re-run the `remoter::client()` call and you should be good to go.  The server should still be running.  You can therefore also have multiple clients connect to the same server, and they will share the same data (though they will not see each other's commands).  I actually consider this a feature, but I'm not married to it and I could probably be convinced to change it.
<br><br>


**Problem**: The up/down arrow keys don't work right when using the client.

**Explanation**: That's because the client is just some R code sitting on top of the R REPL.  This shouldn't be a problem if you're using an IDE like RStudio or the like, where you pass commands from an editor window to the R session.
<br><br>


**Problem**: There's no security!

**Explanation**: Currently there is a password system that works by simple string comparison, and communication is encryption via the **sodium** [[@sodium]] package.  It is possible I messed this up though, so if you believe that ot be the case, I'd really like to know about it.  We are also considering adding CurveZMQ support to pbdZMQ in the future.
<br><br>


**Problem**: Something else is wrong!

**Explanation**: I'm not surprised.  Please be so kind as to [file an issue](https://github.com/wrathematics/remoter/issues) describing the problem.
