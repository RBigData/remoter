server(port = 55555, password = NULL, maxretry = 5,
  secure = has.sodium(), log = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, showmsg = FALSE,
  userpng = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{port}{The port (number) that will be used for communication between 
the client and server.  The port value for the client and server
must agree.}

\item{password}{A password the client must enter before the user can process
commands on the server.  If the value is \code{NULL}, then no
password checking takes place.}

\item{maxretry}{The maximum number of retries for passwords before shutting
everything down.}

\item{secure}{Logical; enables encryption via public key cryptography of
the 'sodium' package is available.}

\item{log}{Logical; enables some basic logging in the server.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; enables the verbose logger.}

\item{showmsg}{Logical; if TRUE, messages from the client are logged.}

\item{userpng}{Logical; if TRUE, rpng is set as the default device for displaying.}

\details{
By a 'secure' server, we mean one that encrypts messages it
sends and only accepts encrypted messages.  Encryption uses
public key cryptography, using the 'sodium' package.

If the 'sodium' package is available to the server, then by 
default the server will be secure.  If the package is not
available, then you will not be able to start a secure server.
If the server is secure, then a client can only connect if
the client has the 'sodium' package available.
