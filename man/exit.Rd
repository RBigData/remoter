\usage{
exit(client.only = TRUE, q.server = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{client.only}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, then the client disconnects from
the server.  Otherwise, the server is shut down together 
with the client.}

\item{q.server}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, then the server calls \code{q("no")}
after shuting down with the client.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{TRUE} invisibly on successful exit.
}
\description{
This function cleanly shuts down the remoter server the client
is currently connected to, as well as shutting down the client.
One can also use \code{q()} (while the client is running), and
this will not close the active R session on the client.
}
\details{
Exit the remoter client/server.
