Title: Remote R: Control a Remote R Session from a Local One
Version: 0.4-1.9001
Description: A set of utilities for client/server computing with R, controlling
    a remote R session (the server) from a local one (the client).  Simply set
    up a server (see package vignette for more details) and connect to it from
    your local R session ('RStudio', terminal, etc).  The client/server
    framework is a custom 'REPL' and runs entirely in your R session without the
    need for installing a custom environment on your system.  Network
    communication is handled by the 'ZeroMQ' library by way of the 'pbdZMQ'
    package.
