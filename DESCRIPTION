Version: 0.2-0
Description: A set of utilities for controlling a remote R session.
    Simply set up a server (see 'README.md' or the package vignette
    for more details) and connect to it from your local R session,
    including RStudio.  Network communication is handled
    by the 'ZeroMQ' library by way of the 'pbdZMQ' package.  The 
    client/server framework is a custom 'REPL'.
