Title: 'pbdR' Client/Server Utilities
Version: 0.1-0
Description: A set of utilities for interactively using the 'pbdR' set
  of packages.  By design, 'pbdR' uses the Single Program/Multiple Data
  or 'SPMD' paradigm, which is inherently batch (non-interactive).
  The client/server allows for the use of interactively controlling
  batch 'SPMD' servers as one would a regular R session.  The
  communication between client and server is handled by 'ZeroMQ',
  and 'intra-server' communication of commands can be handled by 'ZeroMQ'
  or MPI (see vignette for details).
