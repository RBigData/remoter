Title: Remote R: Control a Remote R Session from a Local One
Version: 0.3-3
Description: A set of utilities for controlling a remote R session
    from a local one.  Simply set up a server (see package vignette
    for more details) and connect to it from your local R session,
    including 'RStudio'.  Network communication is handled
    by the 'ZeroMQ' library by way of the 'pbdZMQ' package.  The 
    client/server framework is a custom 'REPL'.
